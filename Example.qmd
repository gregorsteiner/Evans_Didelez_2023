# Data

We use the well-known Lalonde dataset as in @dw_1999 to investigate the causal effect of a job training programme on real earnings.

```{r}
#| tbl-cap: "Chracteristics by treatment status"

lalonde <- haven::read_dta("http://www.nber.org/~rdehejia/data/nsw_dw.dta")

within(lalonde[, -1], treat <- factor(ifelse(treat == 1, "Treated", "Control"))) |>
  gtsummary::tbl_summary(by = treat) 
```
