This is our contribution to the discussion of "Parameterizing and Simulating from Causal Models" by Robin Evans and Vanessa Didelez, read as an RSS discussion paper on 3 October, 2023. 

`Example.qmd` includes the code to replicate our simulation and some additional examples and comments. The STAN files `example.stan` and `example_eta.stan` can be used fit the Bayesian models for the standard and alternative parameterization respectively.
